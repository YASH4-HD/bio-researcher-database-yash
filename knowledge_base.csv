Restriction Enzymes,4.6,Restriction enzymes (REs) are molecular scissors that cut DNA at specific palindromic sequences.,"1️⃣ Restriction enzymes (restriction endonucleases) are enzymes that cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences called recognition sites.

2️⃣ They are naturally present in bacteria as part of the restriction–modification system, protecting against bacteriophage infection.

3️⃣ Most restriction enzymes recognize palindromic DNA sequences (same sequence in 5′→3′ direction on both strands).

4️⃣ They cleave DNA by breaking phosphodiester bonds within or near the recognition sequence.

5️⃣ Restriction enzymes are classified into Type I, Type II, and Type III based on structure, cofactors, and cleavage position.

6️⃣ Type II restriction enzymes are most important in molecular biology because they cut at precise and predictable locations.

7️⃣ DNA cleavage may generate:

Sticky (cohesive) ends – overhanging ends

Blunt ends – straight cuts without overhangs

8️⃣ These enzymes require specific conditions such as:

Mg²⁺ ions

Optimal temperature (usually 37°C)

Suitable pH

9️⃣ They are essential tools in recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, plasmid construction, and genetic mapping.

🔟 Examples include:

EcoRI

HindIII

BamHI

PCR Principles,4.1,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an in vitro method for enzymatic synthesis of specific DNA sequences.,"1️⃣ PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to amplify a specific DNA sequence in vitro.

2️⃣ It was developed by Kary Mullis in 1983, who later received the Nobel Prize (1993).

3️⃣ PCR requires three main components:

Template DNA

Primers (forward & reverse)

Thermostable DNA polymerase

4️⃣ The most commonly used enzyme is Taq DNA polymerase, isolated from Thermus aquaticus.

5️⃣ PCR consists of three cyclic steps:

Denaturation (94–95°C) – DNA strands separate

Annealing (50–65°C) – Primers bind to template

Extension (72°C) – DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA

6️⃣ Each cycle theoretically doubles the DNA amount, leading to exponential amplification (2ⁿ).

7️⃣ PCR requires a machine called a thermal cycler to control temperature changes.

8️⃣ The amplified DNA product is called an amplicon.

9️⃣ Variations of PCR include:

RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR)

qPCR (Quantitative PCR)

Multiplex PCR

🔟 PCR is widely used in:

Disease diagnosis

Forensic science

Genetic engineering

DNA fingerprinting

DNA Ligase,4.8,DNA Ligase facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond.,1. Seals nicks between Okazaki fragments. \n 2. Requires ATP (T4 Ligase) or NAD+ (E. coli). \n 3. Joins 3'-OH and 5'-Phosphate groups. \n 4. Works best on sticky ends but can do blunt ends.,
