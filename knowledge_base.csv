Restriction Enzymes,4.6,Enzymes that cut DNA at specific palindromic sequences.,1.jpg,"Restriction enzymes are DNA-cutting enzymes that recognize and cleave specific nucleotide sequences called recognition sites.

They are naturally found in bacteria as part of a defense system against invading foreign DNA (like bacteriophages).

Most restriction enzymes recognize palindromic sequences (same reading 5′→3′ on both strands).

They cut DNA by breaking phosphodiester bonds at or near the recognition site.

Based on structure and function, they are classified into Type I, Type II, and Type III restriction enzymes.

Type II restriction enzymes are most widely used in molecular biology because they cut at precise positions.

DNA cleavage can produce sticky (cohesive) ends or blunt ends, depending on the enzyme.

Restriction enzymes require specific conditions like optimal temperature, pH, and Mg²⁺ ions for activity.

They are essential tools in recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and genetic engineering.

Common examples include EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, and PstI, widely used in laboratories."
