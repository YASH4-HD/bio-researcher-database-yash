Restriction Enzymes,4.6,Enzymes that cut DNA at specific palindromic sequences.,1.jpg,"Restriction enzymes are DNA-cutting enzymes that recognize and cleave specific nucleotide sequences called recognition sites.

They are naturally found in bacteria as part of a defense system against invading foreign DNA (like bacteriophages).

Most restriction enzymes recognize palindromic sequences (same reading 5′→3′ on both strands).

They cut DNA by breaking phosphodiester bonds at or near the recognition site.

Based on structure and function, they are classified into Type I, Type II, and Type III restriction enzymes.

Type II restriction enzymes are most widely used in molecular biology because they cut at precise positions.

DNA cleavage can produce sticky (cohesive) ends or blunt ends, depending on the enzyme.

Restriction enzymes require specific conditions like optimal temperature, pH, and Mg²⁺ ions for activity.

They are essential tools in recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and genetic engineering.

Common examples include EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, and PstI, widely used in laboratories."
PCR Principles,4.1,Thermal cycling to amplify specific DNA targets using Taq,,"1️⃣ PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to amplify a specific DNA sequence in vitro.

2️⃣ It was developed by Kary Mullis in 1983, who later received the Nobel Prize (1993).

3️⃣ PCR requires three main components:

Template DNA

Primers (forward & reverse)

Thermostable DNA polymerase

4️⃣ The most commonly used enzyme is Taq DNA polymerase, isolated from Thermus aquaticus.

5️⃣ PCR consists of three cyclic steps:

Denaturation (94–95°C) – DNA strands separate

Annealing (50–65°C) – Primers bind to template

Extension (72°C) – DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA

6️⃣ Each cycle theoretically doubles the DNA amount, leading to exponential amplification (2ⁿ).

7️⃣ PCR requires a machine called a thermal cycler to control temperature changes.

8️⃣ The amplified DNA product is called an amplicon.

9️⃣ Variations of PCR include:

RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR)

qPCR (Quantitative PCR)

Multiplex PCR

🔟 PCR is widely used in:

Disease diagnosis

Forensic science

Genetic engineering

DNA fingerprinting
